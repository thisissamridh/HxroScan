# HXROScan

HXROScan is on-chain monitoring platform developed for the HXRO Foundation to track perpetual (perp) trades and provide real-time trade analytics. It leverages the Helius API for scalable, low-latency data fetching and streaming on Solana, providing users with comprehensive insights into trading activity within the HXRO ecosystem. This project is developed under the HXRO Grants Program.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of perpetual futures (perp) trades
- Analytics on total traded volume, average trade price, and product distribution
- Back-end integration with Helius Webhook to handle streaming transactions
- Filters and processes OrderFillEvents, parsing data for insertion into a PostgreSQL database

## Backend Setup

The backend is configured to receive transactions streamed through the Helius Webhook API, specifically for transactions related to the Dexterity Program ID. These transactions are filtered to capture `OrderFillEvents` and are then parsed and stored in a PostgreSQL table for analysis.

## Webhook Setup

The following code snippet can be used to create a Helius Webhook for streaming transactions:

```javascript
const createWebhook = async () => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      'https://api.helius.xyz/v0/webhooks?api-key=<PASTE YOUR API KEY HERE>',
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          webhookURL: 'https://your-railway-deployment.app/webhooks',
          accountAddresses: ['FUfpR31LmcP1VSbz5zDaM7nxnH55iBHkpwusgrnhaFjL'],
          accountAddressOwners: [],
          encoding: 'jsonParsed',
          webhookType: 'raw',
        }),
      }
    );
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log({ data });
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('error', e);
  }
};
createWebhook();
```
````

This code registers a webhook endpoint, where transactions are streamed from the Helius API. The webhook processes transactions, filters for relevant events, and stores data in a PostgreSQL database.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development of backend services
- **AWS** - Hosting and scaling of infrastructure
- **PostgreSQL** - Database for storing transaction data
